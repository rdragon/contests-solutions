// Solved by using pen and paper.
// For the highest 16 digit number the values 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are external.
// We're not sure that these external values lead to a solution, but we're lucky.
// Start with 6. Then for the highest number the next value should be 5.
// We're not sure this leads to a solution, but we're lucky.
// Then, because the total sum equals 2 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 70 = 5 * 14, the next value should be 3.
// Then an external 10 is required, because the 10 needs to be in a row with a 3 and a 1.
// So the next value is 1.
// Then an external 9 is required, because the 9 need to be in the same row as the 1 and the 4.
// The next value is 4.
// Then an external 8 is required, and now so many values have been added that we can easily fill in the last values.
